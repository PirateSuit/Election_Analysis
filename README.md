## Election Audit Summary
Using this code, we were able to easily analyze a list of over 350,000 votes and show detailed results. This code is flexible and could easily be used for other similar election results or even be used for state or nation-wide elections. So long as an appropriately detailed CSV file of the vote results were delivered, any number of candidates or counties or districts or states could be analyized.
